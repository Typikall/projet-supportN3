How to create and host a yum repository over httpd 

1-Set up apache :

    # yum install httpd
    # mkdir /var/www/html/myrepo

    Any RHEL release can be used to host the repository ; this exemple only uses the default configuration, those are just suggestions.

2-On a system of the same release as the repository, gather the rpms and create the repository metadata with createrepo :


    # yum install createrepo
    # mkdir myrepo
    # cp /sourcerpms/some.rpms myrepo
    # cd /path/to/myrepo
    # createrepo /path/to/myrepo

    The RHEL5 version of createrepo require a full path be given as an option or the repository will not be created correctly . To avoid problems, make sure you always use a full path.

3-Copy the folder to your apache server using the method of your choice.
    For convenience, the content of /path/to/myrepo has been copied to /var/www/html/myrepo, including the repodata folder it should now include.
  

    # chmod o+r /var/www/html/myrepo -R
    # chcon -R httpd_sys_content_t /var/www/html/myrepo

    The chcon command is only required if SELinux is in enforcing mode.

4-Configure the clients with a new /etc/yum.repos.d/myrepo.repo


    [myrepo]
    name=my custom repo
    baseurl=http://apacheserver/myrepo
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0

    Depending on your setup, you may want to enable gpgcheck - if for exemple you are sharing content provided by Red Hat from the main repositories (released content, not beta or fasttrack) , the options to configure correctly gpg checks would be


    gpgcheck=1 
    gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release

    The keys are by default installed on systems by a Red Hat release package for your type of installation. For more information on the creation of .repo files, you can check man yum.conf under the section [repository] OPTIONS.

The steps contained in this article work for any release, but the createrepo command must be ran with the createrepo of the RHEL major release for its repository - this is due to format differences in rpm between major releases. This means you need to run createrepo on RHEL5 for a RHEL5 repository, on RHEL6 for a RHEL6 repository and so on.
